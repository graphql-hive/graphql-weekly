# Index Page Fixes

- [x] Green dot is non-obvious — show "published" text instead
- [x] White hover is jarring — make WAY more subtle (one shade), no transition
- [x] Issue number too large — make smaller, add "#" back
- [x] Remove 1-9 jump shortcut (redundant)
- [x] ArrowUp from first issue → focus "Add Issue" input
- [x] Prefill input with next issue number
- [x] Input placeholder almost invisible — fix contrast (also added dark mode)
- [x] Remove long bar divider in list items
- [x] Show link count in list item — skipped, requires prefetching all links
- [x] Keyboard hints: bottom-left, only on xl: breakpoint
- [x] xl: sticky header on left side
